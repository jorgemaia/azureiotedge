# Azure IoT Edge Sample solution

This solution contains various sample custom modules (custom code as well as Azure Function). The modules implement various patters which I would consider good pratice for Edge modules, for instance in terms of logging.
You can find examples for Direct Method invocation, twin (desired properties) updates, and communication of modules outside of Edge Hub.
